# ðŸš— Vehicle Recognition System in Java (OpenCV)

This project is a basic **Vehicle Recognition System** developed in **Java** using **OpenCV**. It can detect vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks) from images and **in real-time** using your webcam.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim

To build a Java-based application capable of recognizing and classifying vehicles from static images or live video streams using computer vision techniques.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Java** â€“ Core programming language
- **OpenCV (Java bindings)** â€“ For image processing and vehicle detection
- **Swing** â€“ For displaying the GUI (real-time video display)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Vehicle detection in static images *(optional)*
- âœ… Real-time vehicle detection via webcam
- âœ… Haar cascade-based detection using `cars.xml`

---

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- Java + OpenCV integration
- Real-time image processing
- Vehicle detection using Haar cascades
- GUI design with Swing
- Handling camera feeds in Java
